  "readme": "Ember Data Local Storage Adapter\n================================\n\nStore your ember application data in localStorage.\n\nCurrently tested against ember-data revision 11.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInclude `localstorage_adapter.js` in your app and then like all adapters:\n\n```js\nApp.store = DS.Store.create({\n  revision: 11,\n  adapter: DS.LSAdapter.create()\n});\n\n```\n\n### Local Storage Namespace\n\nAll of your application data lives on a single `localStorage` key, it defaults to `DS.LSAdapter` but if you supply a `namespace` option it will store it there:\n\n```js\nDS.LSAdapter.create({\n  namespace: 'my app'\n});\n```\n\n### Model \"url\"\n\nIf your model definition has a `url` property, the adapter will store the data on that namespace. URL is a weird term in this context, but it makes swapping out adapters simpler by not requiring additional properties on your models.\n\n```js\nvar List = DS.Model.extend({\n  // ...\n});\nList.reopen({\n  url: '/some/url'\n});\n```\n\n### Quota Exceeded Handler\n\nBrowser's `localStorage` has limited space, if you try to commit application data and the browser is out of space, then the adapter will trigger the `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR` event.\n\n```js\nApp.store.adapter.on('QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR', function(records){\n  // do stuff\n});\n\nApp.store.commit();\n```\n\nTodo\n----\n\n- Figure out how to save a record once its transitioned to the error state.\n- Make the repo nicer to work with long-term (do something more intelligent with dependencies found in `vendor`, etc.)\n- Add some examples\n\nTests\n-----\n\nOpen `tests/index.html` in a browser.\n\nLicense & Copyright\n-------------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Ryan Florence\nMIT Style license. http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n",
